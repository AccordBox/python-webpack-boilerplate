# Code Linting

Code linting on the frontend can guarantee the code quality and make the code more readable. 

We use `eslint` and `stylelint` to lint the code, and you can just use them out of the box.

## ESLint

ESLint is a static code analysis tool for identifying problematic patterns found in JavaScript code. It helps maintain code quality by enforcing coding standards and best practices. Some benefits of using ESLint include:

- **Code Consistency:** ESLint ensures that all code in the project follows the same style and guidelines, making it easier for developers to collaborate.
- **Error Prevention:** It helps catch common programming errors and potential bugs during development.
- **Customizable Rules:** ESLint allows you to configure rules based on your project's specific requirements.
- **Integration:** ESLint can be easily integrated into various build tools and IDEs.

## Stylelint

Stylelint is a linting tool for CSS and SCSS that helps maintain consistent coding styles and prevents errors in your stylesheets. Some benefits of using Stylelint include:

- **Consistent Styles:** Stylelint enforces consistent coding styles across your stylesheets, ensuring a uniform look and feel.
- **Error Detection:** It helps identify errors and potential issues in your CSS code.
- **Customizable Configuration:** Stylelint allows you to configure rules and plugins to suit your project's needs.
- **Integration:** Stylelint can be seamlessly integrated into your build process and editor.
